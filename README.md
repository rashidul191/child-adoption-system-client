## Introduction

A child's parental rights and obligations are legally transferred from the biological parents to the adoptive parents through the process of adoption. It is a difficult and emotional procedure that calls for careful thought and attention to the needs of both the adoptive parents and the child. The present adoption process frequently has delays and inefficiencies, which can lead to lengthy wait times and unneeded stress for all stakeholders.

## Motivation

The goal of the proposed Child Adoption System is to offer a simpler, more effective adoption procedure that is advantageous to all participants. The existing adoption system frequently experiences delays and inefficiencies, which causes extended wait times and unneeded stress for adoptive parents and child welfare organizations.
The suggested solution will take care of these problems by utilizing the most recent technical developments to develop a more thorough and efficient adoption procedure. The program will offer an online adoption application, a consolidated database of kids up for adoption, and eligibility verification.

## Objectives

Our main goal is to provide child to the parents who are alone and want to adopt child. Also children who are living miserable life can get a home, guardian, food, shelter etc. Adoption is the only way to get them those rights. Also there are lot of parents who don’t know if they can effort or adopt a child. The main objective of our project are:
• To Design and develop a child adoption system.
• Finding government and non-government orphanage, child care agency in Bangladesh.
• To testify a user if he/she is applicable or not for child adoption.

## Limitation of our project

The child adoption system- Ador, faces a number of constraints that make it difficult to give every kid in need a safe, secure, and loving home. Some of the limitations include:
▪ Cultural barriers: Adoption still carries a cultural stigma in Bangladesh, which makes it difficult to support and promote it. Cultural impediments to adoption in Bangladesh include the preference for biological children and the notion that adopted children are not the same as biological children.
▪ Lack of awareness: In Bangladesh, there is a pervasive dearth of knowledge regarding adoption, especially in rural areas. Due to the low adoption rates, it is difficult to match needy children with eligible homes.

## Future works
In order to further expand this adoption system, we advise adding NID verification, contact number verification, have own Lawyer and will have an agency so that there will be no dependency on other agency. Also, we can see, the future of the child adoption system- Ador will require a concerted effort from the government, civil society, and international organizations to address the limitations and improve the overall system. Future initiatives to enhance the adoption system include the following:
▪ Increasing awareness: Adoption can be promoted as a practical choice for giving needy children a permanent home by dismantling cultural obstacles and increasing awareness of it and its advantages through educational initiatives and community involvement.
▪ Streamlining legal procedures: The adoption process can be made less daunting for prospective adoptive parents and lead to more adoptions by simplifying and speeding legal processes including court orders and social welfare agency investigation.


## Conclusion
Literature review on child adoption system and problem identification on the existing system. A system has been proposed to solve the existing problems. The 2017 Adoption Regulations control the adoption process in Bangladesh. A complex set of legal steps and prerequisites, such as the requirement for a court order and an inquiry by a social welfare agency, are part of the adoption process. In Bangladesh, adoption generally serves to give children who are orphaned, abandoned, or in other need of care and protection a permanent home. The adoption system has been improved by the government in a number of ways, including the establishment of adoption agencies, but there are still many issues that need to be resolved.
