        <p>
          CASA (Child Adoption System Ador) uses its best efforts to respect the
          privacy of its online visitors. All user data that is not made public,
          including email address and IPs associated with user accounts, will
          not be sold or rented nor will it be shared with any third party
          unless we are required by law. When a visitor requests or read a page,
          or sends email to CASA, no more information is collected than is
          typically collected by websites.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          CASA gathers only personally identifiable data such as names,
          addresses, zip codes, email etc when voluntarily submitted by a
          visitor. For example, if we ask for personal information on our Online
          Donation page, we use the information to acknowledge receipt of your
          donation for tax purposes.

        <p>
          You can access the pages of the website without telling us who you are
          and without revealing any personal information. Our web servers
          collect anonymous logs during user visits to CASA website. This
          information is used to create aggregate statistics. These statistics
          help us understand how our website is used and how we might improve
          viewer experience in the future.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Online Donations</h2>
        <p>
          We request information from the visitor on our donation form. A
          visitor must provide contact information (such as name, email and
          mailing address) and payment information (such as credit card number
          and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes
          and for sending the receipt of the donation within Bangladesh.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If we have trouble processing a donation, the information is used by
          us to contact the donor. We will not share the visitor’s name and
          contact information with any third party. Financial and credit card
          information is CASA disclosed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This should be very much clear that CASA is not willing to accept
          donations earned through illegal and unlawful means.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Cancellation & Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
          No cancellation for the donated amount by any donor will be
          entertained. The donation will be used for the heads selected by the
          donor at our Online Donation page. CASA does not compel any person or
          organization to donate money, rather it depends on one’s own wish
          whether he/she is willing to contribute towards child’s development
          and educational needs of CASA.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But, as far as the refund is concerned, we can have the partial refund
          in case you donated an amount by mistake. Please contact us within 15
          days from the date of your donation if you identify an error in the
          amount of payment or to report unauthorized use of your credit or
          debit card.
